Peter wondered why he didn&#39;t have many friends. The reason was he was always taking, never giving.

One day Peter told Bill, &quot;I&#39;d like to give a party on Saturday, I&#39;d like you to come and bring Martha, too.&quot;&quot;Thanks, Peter. We&#39;d be happy to come.&quot;&quot;Perhaps you&#39;d like to bring your violin. You and Martha sing well together. I&#39;m sure everyone will want you to sing for us.&quot;That was how Peter began to plan his party. Next he asked another friend, Betty, to bring a cake.&quot;You make the best cake in the world, Betty, and I like to eat your cake better than have one from the bakery.&quot;Peter invited a few other friends to come to his party. He didn&#39;t forget to ask something from each one of them. He even asked Jim and Mary Jackson to let him give the party at their house! They agreed.

The party was a big success. However, as the guests were leaving, they said&quot;Thank you &quot;to Bill and Martha for the music, Betty for the cake, the Jacksons for the use of the house and to others for their hard work. To Peter they just said,&quot;Thanks for the invitation.&quot;

Many people who work in London prefer to live outside it, and to go in to their offices or schools every day by train, car or bus, even though this means they have to get up early in the morning and reach home late in the evening.

One advantage of living outside London is that houses are cheaper. Even a small flat in London without a garden costs quite a lot to rent. With the same money, one can get a little house in the country with a garden of one&#39;s own.

Then, in the country one can really get away from the noise and hurry of busy working lives. Even though one has to get up earlier and spend more time in trains or buses, one can sleep better at night and during weekends and on summer evenings, one can enjoy the fresh, clean air of the country. If one likes gardens, one can spend one&#39;s free time digging, planting, watering and doing the hundred and one other jobs which are needed in a garden. Then, when the flowers and vegetables come up, one has got the reward together with those who have shared the secret of Nature.

Some people, however, take no interest in country things: for them, happiness lies in the town, with its cinemas and theatres, beautiful shops and busy streets, dance-halls and restaurants. Such people would feel that their life was not worth living if they had to live it outside London. An occasional walk in one of the parks and a fortnight&#39;s (two weeks) visit to the sea every summer is all the country they want: the rest they are quite prepared to leave to those who are glad to get away from London every night.

In the American family the husband and wife usually share important decision-making. When the children are old enough, they take part as well. Foreigners are often surprised by the permissiveness (宽容) of American parents. Children are often allowed to do pretty much \_\_21\_\_ they wish without strict control by their parents. Children are encouraged to be \_\_22\_\_ at an early age. Some people believe that American parents carry this freedom too far. Others think that a strong parental image would not suit American values. Because Americans emphasize the importance of independence, young people are expected to break away from their families by the time they have \_\_23\_\_ their late teens or early twenties. This pattern of independence often raises serious problems for the aging parents of a small family. The average American is expected to live \_\_24\_\_ the age of 70. The job-retirement age is usually 65. The children have left home, married, and \_\_25\_\_ their own households. Often the major problem of many elderly couples is not economic, but they feel useless and lonely with neither an occupation nor a close family ties.
